# SP 3 - Diabetes
*by gruppEN (Frederik, Robert, Rasmus, Janus)*

Datas√¶t: sklearn.datasets.load_diabetes()

Only use 2 features: bmi & bp
* bmi body mass index
* bp average blood pressure

1. Perform linear regression where x = bmi and y = bp
2. Show the regression equation (y=ax+b)
3. Show the regression line on a scatterplot with the other datapoints.
4. According to your model, what is y when x=2.

# Status

1-4 all done

To run it, just execute the python file like so: `python diabetes.py`

The script will print a string of the regression equation, show a scatter plot of the BMI (x) and blood pressure (y) with the linear regression on top of it. After closing the plot window, it will then print a string with the result of f(2).
